# Morse-Code-Converter

A simple text to Morse Code text and audio converter using a Tkinter interface. Converting text displays the same message in Morse dots and dashes and saves an audio recording of the morse to the 'audio-messages' directory.

The application uses Tkinter 8.6.10 for the interface and Pydub 0.25.1 for the audio concatenation.
